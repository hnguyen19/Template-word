This template is for writing final drafts in .docx to accommodate track-changes and comments that are more straightforward and smoother to do in MSword than in .pdf

The following folders are populated as the manuscript submission progresses. 

1-Background: motivation to conduct the research and relevant .pdf of the literature   
2-Data: raw and clean data sheets  
3-Doc: data management plan and logistical documents  
4-Data-wrangling: `.R` files with codes to clean the raw data  
5-Analysis: 
+ `.Rmd` executable files with codes only to analyze the data and generate figures and tables. Each `.Rmd` file is devoted to address one hypothesis.
+ `.Rmd` excecutable files that produce plain text and references.
6-Draft: to put everything together. `.bib` (the Zotero generated bibliography) `Introduction.Rmd`, `MandM.Rmd`, and `Discussion.Rmd` live here.   
7-Extra: anything else relevant but does not fit into the previous 6 folders. 

General workflow:  
1 - Each `.Rmd` file is devoted to address one hypothesis. 
2 - All the pieces are put together under `Draft.Rmd`. The execution of `Draft.Rmd` will generate: 
  i) a latex-figure folder with all the figures from the `.Rmd` files.
  ii) a `.tex` file and a `.pdf` file.  
3 - The `.tex` file is uploaded to Overleaf for final polishing that are very inconvenient or impossible to do in R. 

I sincerely thank the R user community, `bookdown` authors, Zotero, and ISU Lunchinators for inspiration, coaching, and troubleshooting. 
This current structure works best for me.
